# Fast_neural_style_transfer
 fast_neural_style

This is tensorflow version of how to implement fast neural style transfer.

But the uploaded file is tranferred to achieve super resolution images generation.


a mat file called "imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat" are needed in the loss_net.py since this file already had a whole framework of VGG19, so we just need to download it from network.

Training dataset are also needed. Here we use COCO dataset.

These codes could be used in the fast neural network jobs but you need to change some codes among loss_net.py, train.py and tranfer.py. It is easy if you look through the whole essays of fast neural style tranfer.

sorry for this belief description, but if I get time I will try to make it clear.
